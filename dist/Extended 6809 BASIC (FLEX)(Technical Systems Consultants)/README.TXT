Technical Systems Consultants Extended BASIC
========================================================================

This package contains TSC Extended BASIC copied from a physical
floppy disk found in MikeyN6IL's Collection.

The same disk image is provided in 3 different formats: SCP, DMK, and SDF

Note that DSK or IMA format sector images are not provided because they are
not useful on a CoCo.  HxCFlopyEmulator Software or Mikey's dmk tool can be
used to create them.
